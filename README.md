# D
The D language is inspired by c, however uses bytecode compilation, similar to java

# Compiling and running
Since the language uses bytecode you need to compile your `.d` to `.dbc` (D ByteCode)

To do this you can use `dic` (D Init Compiler)

Then to run the code you can use the interpriter `d`
